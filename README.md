# T64-to-D64
Convert Commodore T64 files to D64 format using drag and drop.

This program will greatly simplify the batch processing of T64 files.
Just put all the T64 files in a folder. Drag that folder on the script and watch the magic go.

In order to work properly, you need the c1541.exe file from the VICE64 emulator which can be found here (http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/).
Copy the c1541.exe file in a folder named c1541 and located in the same folder as the script.
Edit the script to point the file to the correct location. That's it.
Everything in the script is described in detail.

Enjoy!
